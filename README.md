# Haskell Undefined Value Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell programming: attempting to use an undefined value. The `undefined` value represents a computation that has not yet been given a meaning, and trying to use it will result in a runtime error.

The `bug.hs` file contains the buggy code.  The `bugSolution.hs` provides a corrected version.  This example highlights the importance of proper handling of potentially undefined values to avoid unexpected crashes in Haskell programs.
